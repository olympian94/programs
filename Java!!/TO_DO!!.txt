
Exercise 13.3: As shown, the delimitedString method assumes only one such string per input string.
Write a version that will pull out all the delimited strings and return an array.

Exercise 13.4: Write a program to read an input string with lines of the form "type value", where type is
one of the wrapper class names (Boolean, Character, and so on) and value is a string that the type's
constructor can decode. For each such entry, create an object of that type with that value and add it to an

For example, the following simple algorithm squeezes out all occurrences of a character from a string:
